## Overview  
CareLinks is a user-friendly web app designed to make life easier for community health workers (CHWs) and the people they care for. The app helps CHWs keep track of patient records, schedule appointments, and send reminders for routine checkups or vaccinations. It’s especially focused on helping the elderly who need regular care and children who require timely vaccinations.
CareLinks also allows CHWs to report malnutrition cases, monitor disease outbreaks in their area, and share important health updates with patients. By using technology, it bridges the gap in healthcare access and ensures that people in underserved areas get the attention they need without unnecessary delays. CareLinks is all about empowering CHWs to provide better, personalized care while making healthcare more accessible and efficient

## Inspiration  
CareLinks draws inspiration from a close family member who works as a community health worker (CHW). Witnessing their dedication and the challenges they face in providing care to underserved communities sparked the idea to create a tool that empowers CHWs and amplifies their impact.
Additionally, data highlighting India's rapidly aging population—projected to rise by 41% in the next decade to reach 194 million by 2031—underscores the urgent need for personalized healthcare solutions for the elderly. At the same time, grassroots-level issues like inconsistent vaccination coverage and malnutrition among children remain critical barriers to achieving equitable healthcare.
CareLinks is a response to these challenges, aiming to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility by equipping CHWs with the tools they need to deliver timely, personalized care and improve health outcomes for vulnerable populations.

## Goals  
### Reducing Healthcare Gaps:  
- **Short-term Goal:**
  Empower CHWs with tools to digitize patient records, schedule appointments, and share healthcare camp details, ensuring immediate access to vital information for underserved communities.
  
- **Long-term Goal:**  
  Bridge the healthcare divide by enabling 90% of CHWs across underserved regions to actively use CareLinks, resulting in increased healthcare accessibility and improved health outcomes for vulnerable populations over the next five years.

## Built With
CareLinks is powered by modern and robust technologies to deliver a seamless experience for community health workers and NGOs:

- **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript) for a scalable and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Firebase:
  - Firestore for real-time database and patient data management.
  - Firebase Hosting for deploying the app.
  - Cloud Functions for serverless backend logic.
  - Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-ins.
- **APIs**:
  - Firebase Admin SDK for advanced app administration.
  - OpenAI integration for generating chatbot responses.
- **Styling Frameworks**: TailwindCSS for modern, responsive UI design.
- **Other Tools**: Jira (or equivalents) for project management during development.

## Challenges
Developing CareLinks came with its fair share of obstacles. Here are some major challenges we encountered and how we overcame them:

### 1. **Environment Variables and API Key Exposure**
   - **Challenge**: Accidentally pushing sensitive `.env` files to the GitHub repository.
   - **Solution**: Implemented strict `.gitignore` rules and rotated API keys to secure the project.

### 2. **Real-time Data Updates**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring that patient data updates in real-time without delays or inconsistencies.
   - **Solution**: Leveraged Firebase Firestore's real-time capabilities and optimized queries for efficient data syncing.

### 3. **Complex Patient Record Structures**
   - **Challenge**: Managing nested patient data fields (e.g., symptoms, vitals) while maintaining flexibility for future fields.
   - **Solution**: Carefully designed Firestore data models and created helper functions for dynamic handling.

### 4. **User Authentication**
   - **Challenge**: Seamlessly integrating Firebase Authentication for both health workers and NGO admins.
   - **Solution**: Used Firebase Authentication combined with role-based access controls.

### 5. **Collaboration Features**
   - **Challenge**: Enabling seamless communication between community health workers via a chat interface.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a lightweight chat system using Firebase's real-time database features.
